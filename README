CS 4760 - Assignment 2

Details:
	Calling master will fork off n children, with s children running at any given time.
	The workers, called by execl, increment a clock in shared memory. The clock is
	inremented by n * 1,000,000 millis for every child called. After 2 seconds, the program 
	will terminate with force. 

	The idea of the project is that is the value of s = 1, no race condition occurs.
	For values of s > 1 while n > 1, a race condition occurs.
Usage:
	./Worker 			Is an executable called by Master
	
	./Master -h			Master help menu

	./Master -n (int) -s (int)	N forks are made, max of s at any given time
